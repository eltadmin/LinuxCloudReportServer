# Debug Report: Client-Server Communication Issues

This document describes the issues found in the TCP communication between the Delphi client and the Python server implementation, along with the fixes applied.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Crypto Dictionary Entry Mismatch

The CRYPTO_DICTIONARY entry for ID=7 was incorrect in the Python implementation. 

**Original (incorrect):**
```python
'YGbsux&Ygsyx'  # Missing trailing 'g'
```

**Fixed:**
```python
'YGbsux&Ygsyxg'  # Matching exactly what's in the Delphi client
```

This ensures that both client and server generate identical crypto keys.

### 2. Line Ending Issues

Delphi's `TStrings.Values` property is sensitive to line endings, requiring CRLF (`\r\n`) format. The Python server was using LF (`\n`) endings for some responses.

**Fixed:**
- All responses now consistently use CRLF line endings
- INIT response format matches exactly what the Delphi client expects
- Added trailing blank line (double CRLF) for all command responses

### 3. Response Format for Encrypted Data

The format of responses containing encrypted data (like INFO and VERS commands) needed to be consistent.

**Fixed:**
```
200 OK\r\nDATA={encrypted_data}\r\n\r\n
```

## Testing Tools Added

To help with debugging, the following tools were created:

1. `debug_protocol.py` - Improved to analyze server responses at the byte level and simulate key generation
2. `debug_test_init.py` - A standalone test server that simulates correct INIT responses

## Verification Steps

1. Start the server with Docker Compose:
   ```
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Run the debug protocol script to test INIT command:
   ```
   python3 debug_protocol.py
   ```

3. Run full communication test:
   ```
   python3 debug_protocol.py 127.0.0.1 8016 full
   ```

## Key Observations

The Delphi client expects very specific formatting for TCP responses:

1. Status code on first line with CRLF: `200 OK\r\n`
2. Key-value pairs with key at start of line: `KEY=value\r\n`
3. CRLF line endings for all lines
4. Blank line (double CRLF) at end of response

The original CloudTcpServer implementation uses the `TStrings.Values` property which is sensitive to this format. Any deviation causes the client to fail with the "Unable to initialize communication" error we were seeing.

## Conclusion

After applying these fixes, the Delphi client should now be able to communicate correctly with the Python server implementation, preserving the exact behavior of the original Windows server.
