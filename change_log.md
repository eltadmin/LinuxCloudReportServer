## Change Log for Linux Cloud Report Server

### 2025-04-15 - Added Deployment and Verification Tools

**Changes Made**:
1. Created deployment scripts to simplify pushing updates to the server:
   - `deploy_update.sh`: Bash script for Linux environments
   - `deploy_update.bat`: Batch script for Windows environments
2. Created verification tools to check server functionality:
   - `verify_server.py`: Python script to test server connectivity and functionality
   - `verify_server.bat`: Batch script to run the verification tool

**Files Added**:
- `deploy_update.sh`: Script to deploy changes to the server
- `deploy_update.bat`: Windows version of the deployment script
- `verify_server.py`: Server verification tool
- `verify_server.bat`: Windows batch script to run the verification tool

**Benefits**:
- Simplified deployment process
- Easy verification of server functionality after updates
- Better debugging and troubleshooting capabilities

### 2025-04-15 - Fix for Missing Constants in tcp_server.py

**Issue**: Server fails to start due to undefined constants
- Error messages in the logs:
  - `NameError: name 'INACTIVITY_CHECK_INTERVAL' is not defined`
  - `NameError: name 'CMD_INFO' is not defined`
- The refactored code referenced constants that were not defined at the top of the file

**Changes Made**:
1. Added command constants (CMD_INIT, CMD_ERRL, CMD_PING, CMD_INFO, etc.)
2. Added timeout constants:
   - CONNECTION_TIMEOUT = 300 (5 minutes)
   - PENDING_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT = 120 (2 minutes)
   - INACTIVITY_CHECK_INTERVAL = 60 (1 minute)
3. Added key generation constants (KEY_LENGTH)
4. Added RESPONSE_FORMATS dictionary for consistent response formatting

**Files Modified**:
- `server/tcp_server.py`: Added missing constants

**Expected Results**:
- Server should start without errors
- The connection cleanup task should run properly
- Command handling should work correctly

### 2025-04-15 - Code Refactoring of tcp_server.py

**Changes Made**:
1. Improved code organization and structure
   - Added proper docstrings to all classes and methods
   - Added type hints for better code clarity
   - Organized imports logically
   - Added constants for configuration values
   - Extracted command handling into separate methods

2. Added better separation of concerns between classes
   - TCPConnection class focuses solely on connection management
   - Added new helper methods to make code more modular
   - Extracted common functionality into separate methods

3. Enhanced error handling and logging
   - Added more detailed log messages
   - Improved exception handling patterns
   - Added context to error logs

4. Improved the INIT command handling
   - Refactored into smaller, more focused methods
   - Better handling of crypto key testing
   - Improved response formatting for Delphi client compatibility

5. Improved connection cleanup
   - Added dedicated method for connection cleanup
   - Added proper task cancellation and resource cleanup
   - Added more robust connection tracking

**Files Modified**:
- `server/tcp_server.py`: Major refactoring of the code

**Benefits**:
- More maintainable codebase
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved readability
- More robust error handling
- Easier to extend and modify in the future

### 2025-04-15 - Fix for INIT command response format

**Issue**: Client can't initialize communication with server
- The Delphi client code expects the INIT response to be in a specific format with key-value pairs
- The current server implementation is sending a response format that the client doesn't understand
- Specifically, the client is looking for `LEN=8` and `KEY=ABCDEFGH` in the server response

**Investigation**:
- Analyzed logs which show client sending: `ERRL [Error]Unable to initizlize communication! Terminate connection`
- Looking at the Delphi client code, it expects the response to contain values accessible via `FTCPClient.LastCmdResult.Text.Values['LEN']` and `FTCPClient.LastCmdResult.Text.Values['KEY']`
- The client builds the crypto key as: `KEY value + dict_part + hostname_chars`
- Current server response format is: `200 OK\nLEN=8\nKEY=ABCDEFGH\n`

**Changes Made**:
1. Modified the server's INIT response format to match what the Delphi client expects
2. Changed from using format6 (with status line) to format1 (standard Delphi format):
   - Old: `200 OK\nLEN=8\nKEY=ABCDEFGH\n`
   - New: `LEN=8\r\nKEY=ABCDEFGH`
3. Used CRLF line endings (`\r\n`) as is standard in Delphi applications
4. Improved error logging for ERRL commands to provide more details about:
   - The correct format expected by the Delphi client
   - How the Delphi client parses the response
   - Host component analysis for better debugging

**Files Modified**:
- `server/tcp_server.py`: Modified the INIT response format and improved error logging

**New Files Created**:
- `change_log.md`: This log file to track changes
- `test_init_format.py`: Test script to verify the INIT command response format
- `test_init_format.bat`: Windows batch script to run the test
- `restart_server.sh`: Shell script to restart the server (for Linux environments)

**Expected Results**:
- The client should now be able to correctly parse the response
- The client will successfully create the crypto key and continue with the connection
- If there are still issues, the enhanced logging will provide more information for debugging

**How to Test**:
1. Deploy the updated code to the server
2. Restart the server using `restart_server.sh` on Linux or by restarting the Docker container
3. Run the test script `test_init_format.py` to verify the response format
4. Try connecting with a real client to verify the fix
